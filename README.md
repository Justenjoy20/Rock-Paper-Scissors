# Rock-Paper-Scissors

FirstJsproject
First remember think.

1. Understand the problem
2. Plan and write pseudocode
3. Divise and conquer (make it simple, divise the problem into more simple problems)

I started to do the project but it revealed to be harder than I expected.
I will start again the points I don't understand.
